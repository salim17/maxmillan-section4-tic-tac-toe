      <!-- The reason for that is that images (or, in general: files) stored in public/ are made publicly available 
       by the underlying project development server & build process. Just like index.html, those files can directly 
       be visited from inside the browser and can therefore also be requested by other files.
       If you try loading localhost:5173/some-image.jpg, you'll be able to see that image
      (if it exists in the public/ folder, of course). So need to refer the pull path also like public/game-logo.png-->
